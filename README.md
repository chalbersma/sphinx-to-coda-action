# sphinx-to-coda-action

[Coda.IO](https://coda.io/) is a wiki system that a lot of people like and use. One of it's main draws is
search, one of the things that Github Pages doesn't do well. This action will allow you to take your
GitHub Pages Site and upload all or some of it to Coda so it can be searched. You can choose to upload
just a single page or all of them.

Initially this explicitly was uploading an interpretation of intersphinx files. But I've found that it works
quite well uploading the primary index page of a sphinx site (assuming that site has a comprehensive Table of Contents).
